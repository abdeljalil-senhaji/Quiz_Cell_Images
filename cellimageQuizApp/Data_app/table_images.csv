23	12075	High resolution view of the bundles of microtubules that arise from along the elaborately woven blanket of the filamentous reticulum that covers the ribbed wall of the right side of the buccal cavity. A bundle forms beneath the bottom of each rib of the ribbed wall and runs parallel to the depression of the rib. These bundles then extend beyond the posterior terminus of the buccal cavity where they are then collectively called the postoral fiber. In addition single microtubules seem to lie deeper in the cytosol at approximately right angles to the bundles. TEM taken on 7/5/96 by R. Allen with Zeiss 10A operating at 80kV. Neg. 9,780X.Cells were lightly fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde and infiltrated with 2.3M sucrose before being frozen in liquid nitrogen and thin sectioned at a temperature of –100°C at approximately 75nm thickness.

26	39139	Receptor mediated endocytosis is a process in which extracellular molecules are taken into the cell via coated vesicles that pinch from the plasma membrane. In Paramecium the resulting vesicles fuse with flattened cisterna called early endosomes. Early endosomes accumulate just under the cortex of the cell. Sorting of proteins destined to be returned to the plasma membrane after separating from cargo occurs in the early endosomes and is facilitated by the formation of secondary coated pits and vesicles on the early endosomes that are smaller than the coated and uncoated preendosomal vesicles that arise from the plasma membrane. These small coated pits pinch off and subsequently lose their coats to form carrier vesicles that are roughly 100nm in diameter. These vesicles move deeper into the cell where they bind to microtubular ribbons. TEM taken on 11/4/68 by R. Allen with Philips 300 operating at 60kV.

28	12590	Immuno-gold labeling of corn stunt spiroplasma (CSS, Spiroplasma kunkelii, Class Mollicutes) in sieve elements and other phloem cells of infected maize root tissue. In this image, CSS appears to be crossing a sieve pore in the phloem sieve plate. CIL:19128, from the same image group, is a labeled version of this image.  CSS is a wall-less procaryote that causes corn stunt disease and is biologically transmitted by some leafhopper species, e.g. Dalbulus maidis and D. gelbus (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae). Spiroplasma cells are limited by a unit membrane with no cell wall. They can be quasi-spherical, pleiomorphic or maintain a filamentous/spiral form. CSS multiplies in both plant and insect hosts and is transmitted with salivary secretions during feeding of the vector on new host plants.

32	17445	We raised a monoclonal antibody in mouse to an antigen called C6 found on the surface of Paramecium. As seen in this micrograph the gold heavily labels the ciliary membrane and cell surface. In addition the gold is found in the parasomal sacs, in preendosomal vesicles and in early endosomes. However, there is almost no gold in the small coated evaginations of the early endosome or in the carrier vesicles escaping from the early endosomes. We conclude that this antigen passes no further into the cell and is recycled back to the plasma membrane. This antigen could be a cargo receptor that is cycled between the plasma membrane and the early endosome. The cargo may fall off this receptor in the early endosome and be concentrated in the small coated evaginations as is HRP for transport deeper into the cell. TEM taken on 5/14/91 by R. Allen with Zeiss 10A operating at 80kV. Neg. 12,000X. Bar = 0.5µm. Published in J. Cell Sci. 101:449-461, 1992. Adapted with permission from J. Cell Sci. 101:449-461, 1992.

84	24579	A single frame from the movie (CIL:20154) that shows a large rounded monkey kidney cell being penetrated by a pseudopodium followed by the whole Balamuthia ameba. Detection of the ameba within, rather than on, or beneath the cell is indicated by the change in clarity of the ameba outside and then inside the cell"s exterior membrane. The ameba with splayed pseudopodia had begun to enter in apparently a slit in the surface of the cell. The integrity of the cell is maintained and its size does not change appreciably. The portion of the ameba within the cell is less clear than that portion still outside, and as it continues movement within the cell that continues until only a small portion (tail) of the ameba remains outside. Photographed at 1200X. Additional photographs (grouped with this movie) show the movement of the ameba inside of the cell its movement deforms the rounded exterior membrane before the whole ameba emerges some 20 minutes later.	phase contrast microscopy	cell by organism	cell	doi:10.7295/W9CIL24579	Balamuthia mandrillaris
85	24570	This photograph and CIL:24571 show the extent of some amebae in a cell culture at lower magnification. In the movie (CIL:20153) an amoeba, Balamuthia mandrillaris, within a culture of feeder cells is extended from its branched pseudopodia at the upper left corner of the picture while its rope-like body curves over and around a nucleus of a monkey kidney cell; additional branches extended both downward and upward into and between other cells. Those branches terminate with more finger-like pseudopodia projections. The density and the movement of the cytoplasmic granules delineate the ameba from its feeder cells that, by comparison, are quiescent with few scattered cytoplasmic granules and a large, rounded nucleus containing several dense nucleoli. The purpose of this movie is to indicate the identity of an ameba amongst other cells in the co-culture. It shows the expanse of the ameba and its simultaneous involvement with several cells. Observations of the amebas under such conditions show their movement and interactions as they feed in a dimension unlike that of the amebas identification in sectioned material obtained from cases of amebic encephalitis.

88	8864	This is part of a triplicate data set of non-overlapping fields of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts cultured on polystyrene.  Each set is indicated by the well number.  Each image contains 4 images of each field as a time series.  The first image is the phase contrast image.  The second image channel is Tenascin-C promoter driven destabilized EGFP reporter vector.  The third image is Texas Red C2-maleimide (to stain cell body), and the fourth image is Dapi (to stain nuclei).   Images were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 100. The samples were viewed with a Zeiss A-plan 10x Ph1 0.25 NA objective and recorded with a CoolSnapFX camera using 2 x 2 binning. The filters were as follows: 1.) A custom dichroic multipass beam splitter optimized for imaging DAPI, EGFP and TxRed (part# BS51019+400dclp, Chroma Technology, VT); 2.) DAPI excitation filter-360/40 nm; 3.) DAPI emission filter-460/50 nm; 4.) EGFP excitation filter-470/40 nm; 5.) EGFP emission filter-525/50 nm; 6.) TxRed excitation filter-568/24 nm; 7.) TxRed emission filter-630/60 nm. Autofocus on the TxRed color channel was performed at each location before the series of images were collected.Protocol: The cells were seeded on TCPS dishes at ~1000 cells/well during a passage cycle. The test cultures were incubated overnight before being rinsed with PBS and then fixed with 300 uM m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (MBS) in microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB) composed of 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 100 mM 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES),10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), pH 6.9 for at least 16h at RT. The fixative was removed and solution of 0.05% Triton X100 in PBS containing 10 ng/mL of Tx Red C2-maleimide and 2 ng/mL DAPI for 2h. The staining solution was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS/3% BSA, and 0.05% sodium azide and PBS. A 50% glycerol/10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 containing 2ng/mL DAPI and 0.9g/l 1,4-diazobicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO) as an antifade reagent was then added to each well for imaging purposes. The bottom of the wells were wiped with 70% ethanol wipe and then a dry wipe before imaging.Purpose: The purpose of the dataset was to measure the distribution of EGFP fluorescence intensities within individual cells in the population. Using the image sets collected, a plugin for ImageJ was used to perform the following image analysis tasks. 1.) The Txred images (which is a general purpose cell body stain) were segmented by manual thresholding. 2.) The resulting mask was used to define cell ROIs on the DAPI and EGFP images. 3.) The number of nuclei in each ROI is determined from the DAPI image and the integrated intensity of the EGFP signal in the cell is determined from ROI in the EGFP image. 4.) A local background intensity around each cell in the EGFP image is determined by dilating the ROI by 3 pixels and determining the pixel intensities in only the 3 pixel dilation area. When this data is placed in a spread sheet, you can use the results to identify cell clusters (i.e. have more than 1 nuclei), debris or partial cell (i.e. no nuclei), poor EGFP/cell measurements (i.e. high background intensity). The spreadsheet can be used to measure the distribution of EGFP cell intensities within a population of cells. The phase images were collected as quality control and validation data. The phase images provide a human validation mechanism if there are questions about the staining and/or fluorescence detection in an image.References: 1.

As our heads move, fluid flows over the hair bundles (red) pushing them backwards and forwards. The nerves (green) connected to the base of the hair cells then send messages to the brain. By interpreting these movements the brain enables us to make any compensating movements and so keep our balance.

EGFP expression was amplified with chicken anti-GFP (Abcam, 1:2000); cell bodies and fibers are present throughout all layers of the hippocampus but enriched in the hilus and stratum lacunosum moleculare (see associated images).  CB1 immunoreactivity (L15 rabbit polyclonal 1:200, K. Mackie) is prominent in the terminals of basket cells synapsing in the pyramidal cell layer.  CB1 is also enriched in axons with distinct intensities in the inner and outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. CB immunoreactivity is also present in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare. Section (40 um) was mounted with Fluoromount G and imaged with a 5X, 0.15 NA Achroplan objective on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope.  AF568 was excited at 562/40 nm and emission collected at 624/40 nm with Semrock filters and a single band dichroic (530-585 nm reflected, 601-800 nm transmitted). AF488 was excited at 482/35 nm and emission collected at 536/40 nm with Semrock filters and a single band dichroic (446-499 nm reflected, 513-735 nm transmitted). DAPI was excited at 350/50 nm and emission collected at 460/50 nm with a CLP400 dichroic (Chroma). Single images were captured for each channel using a Zeiss Axiocam MR CCD and pseudo-colored using Axiovision.  Linear background subtraction was used on the presented image.  See Davis and Puhl 2011 (Pubmed ID 21305052) for a detailed staining protocol.

117	7620	Junctional complex between two cells in the epithelium of the rat intestinal mucosa. The tight junction (also known as zonula occludens) is the structure located nearest to the lumen. The elimination of the intercellular gap (approx 90 angstroms) is clearly visible, but the fusion line of the two apposed membranes cannot be clearly distinguished at this magnification. The adherens junction (also known as zonula adherens) is the next structure. A relatively wide intercellular space (approx 200 angstroms) is maintained throughout this junction. Extensive actin filament networks are seen along both sides of the junction which are continuous with the terminal web into which the filamentous rootlets of the mircovilli penetrate. Dense material can be seen along parts of both sides of the junction. The limits of a desmosome are marked by the edges of the dense plaques. Desmosomes are characterized by a wide intercellular space (approx 240 angstroms) bisected by an intermediate line. Bundles of intermediate filaments (diameter approx 80 angstroms) converge into a dense plaque on each side of the desmosome. The trilaminar structure of the cell membrane is clearly seen along the microvilli, between the Zonula Adherens and the desmosome and within the desmosome.First description of 1) tight junctions and 2) the junctional complexes between epithelial cells, consisting of tight junction, adherens junction and a desmosome.

118	34611	Cross section the 9 + 2 axoneme of the cilium of Tetrahymena. The plasma membrane covers the axoneme and is continuous with the plasma membrane covering the cell body. Each doublet tilts inward to the tangent of the axonemal cylinder. Two arms, an inner arm and outer arm, extend from the complete microtubule of each doublet. These arms have ATPase activity and are called dyneins. They cause one doublet to slide against the adjacent doublet. Other protein links in the axoneme are elastic and induce the characteristic bending of the cilium and prevent excess sliding as the doublets slide past each other. TEM taken on 7/15/67 by R.
