1	1	fluorescence microscopy	A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence instead of, or in addition to, scattering, reflection, and attenuation or absorption, to study the properties of organic or inorganic substances.[1][2] "Fluorescence microscope" refers to any microscope that uses fluorescence to generate an image, whether it is a more simple set up like an epifluorescence microscope or a more complicated design such as a confocal microscope
2	1	scanning electron microscopy (SEM)	A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface topography and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image.
3	1	transmission electron microscopy (TEM)	Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a charge-coupled device.
4	1	phase contrast microscopy	Phase-contrast microscopy is an optical microscopy technique that converts phase shifts in light passing through a transparent specimen to brightness changes in the image. Phase shifts themselves are invisible, but become visible when shown as brightness variations.
5	2	pollen wall	The pollen wall, the sporoderm, is the most complex wall system in the life cycle of higher plants. It includes three main domains that are highly different in their chemical composition, morphological structure, and physiological and biological significance. These domains are intine, exine, and pollen coat. The exine (the outer, resistant, and rigid layer) is richly sculptured and ornamented. It is composed of sporopollenin, an organic biopolymer of extremely high stability. The outer pollen wall with its structures and surface substances takes part in the process of adaptation between the pollen and environment. The exine is a storage layer for materials synthesized mainly by the anther tapetum.
6	2	dendrite	Dendrites (from Greek δένδρον déndron, "tree"), also dendrons, are branched protoplasmic extensions of a nerve cell that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the neuron from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons (usually via their axons) via synapses which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree. Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which action potentials are produced by the neuron
7	2	synaptic vesicle	In a neuron, synaptic vesicles (or neurotransmitter vesicles) store various neurotransmitters that are released at the synapse. The release is regulated by a voltage-dependent calcium channel. Vesicles are essential for propagating nerve impulses between neurons and are constantly recreated by the cell. The area in the axon that holds groups of vesicles is an axon terminal or "terminal bouton". Up to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of stimulation at 0.2 Hz. In the visual cortex of the human brain, synaptic vesicles have an average diameter of 39.5 nanometers (nm) with a standard deviation of 5.1 nm.
8	2	microtubule cytoskeleton	Microtubules are polymers of tubulin that form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. Microtubules can grow as long as 50 micrometres and are highly dynamic. The outer diameter of a microtubule is between 23 and 27 nm[2] while the inner diameter is between 11 and 15 nm.[3] They are formed by the polymerization of a dimer of two globular proteins, alpha and beta tubulin into protofilaments that can then associate laterally to form a hollow tube, the microtubule.[4] The most common form of a microtubule consists of 13 protofilaments in the tubular arrangement.
9	2	desmosome	A desmosome (/ˈdɛzməˌsoʊm/;[1][2] "binding body"), also known as a macula adherens (plural: maculae adherentes) (Latin for adhering spot), is a cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion. A type of junctional complex, they are localized spot-like adhesions randomly arranged on the lateral sides of plasma membranes. Desmosomes are one of the stronger cell-to-cell adhesion types and are found in tissue that experience intense mechanical stress, such as cardiac muscle tissue, bladder tissue, gastrointestinal mucosa, and epithelia.
10	2	axoneme	An axoneme is the microtubule-based cytoskeletal structure that forms the core of a cilium or flagellum.[1] Cilia and flagella are found on many cells, organisms, and microorganisms, to provide motility. The axoneme serves as the "skeleton" of these organelles, both giving support to the structure and, in some cases, the ability to bend. Though distinctions of function and length may be made between cilia and flagella, the internal structure of the axoneme is common to both.
11	2	endoplasmic reticulum	 The largest organelle in many cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of interconnected membranous tubes and sacs that serve as locations for protein and lipid synthesis. The rough ER is covered with ribosomes where the information carried in messenger RNA molecules is translated into proteins. These newly-synthesized amino acid chains enter the lumen of the rough ER, where the proteins are modified by folding and the addition of molecules that can help target them for trafficking to different locations. The smooth ER does not have associated ribosomes (and thus looks .smooth. in electron micrographs) and is a site for lipid synthesis.
12	2	mitochondrion	The mitochondrion (/ˌmaɪtəˈkɒndrɪən/, plural mitochondria) is a semi autonomous double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may, however, lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.
